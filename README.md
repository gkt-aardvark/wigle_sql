# wigle_sql
Just some simple utilities to pull data from wigle sqlite databases

These two utilities do the following:

wigle_pull.py: - performs a SQL query on as many wiglewifi databases you have in the specified folder.

			   - I have many phones that I use to wardrive, so I end up with many databases.
			   
			   - This outputs the results to the file you specify in the code in TSV format.

wigle_sql.py: - performs a SQL query on a running Android phone with Wigle Wardriving installed.

			  - just change the SQL query to change output
			  
			  - need sqlite3 binary (link in script)
			  
			  - need adb in your path (link in script)
			  
			  - stages a sql command file in /data/local/tmp and queries the /sdcard/wiglewifi/wiglewifi.sqlite db
			  
			  - outputs the results to a csv, also in /data/local/tmp
			  
			  - pulls that file to local system with adb pull
			  
			  - deletes the output.csv from /data/local/tmp
